# Photo Gallery

## Project Description

An image gallery with hundreds of photos taken by me while living in Thailand over the last several years. The same interface can possibly be used for organizing and displaying a collection of any other photo albums or image sets.

* The main idea of this project is designing a convenient UI for viewing a large amount of images with some data attached to them. The data is used both for organizing the photos and for providing additional context.

* All photos are sorted into galleries by when and where they were taken. Each image also has several tags, which may include the weather, time of day, or some features present in the photo. Pictures can be automatically grouped into galleries by each of these tags.

* Each image has a caption. Those are mostly boring, but explain what exactly is shown in the photo. Such notes can provide additional interesting info in some cases.

* The user can always switch between several different ways of viewing the same gallery. Each image can also be easily viewed in full size or downloaded.
    
* There are some experimental features, such as the no-click mode that allows to switch between images by simply hovering over the preview.
    
* The UI is not cluttered with unnecessary junk, such as likes or social buttons. Most of the existing features (such as captions and tags) can also be completely hidden.
